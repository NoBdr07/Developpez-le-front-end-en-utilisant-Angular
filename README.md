# OlympicGamesStarter

This application provides information on the medal histories of countries in the Olympic Games. Using charts, it first displays the total number of medals by country, then shows the progression of achievements for each country, and offers more detailed information on a specific country page.

## How to start

Clone this project with `git clone https://github.com/NoBdr07/Developpez-le-front-end-en-utilisant-Angular.git`.  

You must have this configuration to make this app works :  
    - Angular et Angular CLI version 17.3.8 ;  
    - Typescript version 5.4.5 ;  
    - Swimlane/ngx-charts version 20.5.0 (for the charts);  
    - Node version 20.10.0 ;  
    - Fortawesome/fontawesome-free version 6.5.2.  

Install the dependencies with : `npm install`.  

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.   
The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.  
This app was developped with VS Code and Mozilla Firefox.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Architecture

The architecture includes (in addition to the default angular architecture) the following:
```
└───src  
    ├───app  
    │   ├───core  
    │   │   ├───models  
    │   │   └───services  
    │   └───pages  
    │       ├───detail  
    │       ├───home  
    │       └───not-found  
    ├───assets  
    │   └───mock  
    ├───component (contains every reusable component)  
    │   ├───info (for the info bubbles)  
    │   └───title (for the title of each page)  
    └───environments  
```
## Data

The data of this project is in assets/mock/olympic.json. If you add data there it will work anyway.  
You can also create an API but you'll have to implement the back-end.  

## Responsiveness

This app works on both computer and phone.   
The main difference is that the tooltips that appears when the cursor is over the pie chart can't appear on a phone/pad.  

## Routing

Routing is managed by app-routing.module and a guard was implemented to avoid problems when you enter a country in the URL that doesn't appear in the data. The guard is in core/services.
If you enter a country that isn't in the data or a wrong route, you will be redirected to the home page.
